											<h4>Question-tracking tool</h4>
											<section></section>
											<p>This tally sheet was provided to nine analytical chemistry TAs during the Spring 2019 semester to track the category 
												and "quality" of questions the TAs received from their students during the course-integrated research project. In this 
												context, "quality" or "insightfulness" was a measure of how much prior thought or effort a student appeared to have put into
												answering their question themselves, before seeking an answer from their TA. Check out my <a href="/teaching/tar+project.html">TAR Project</a> 
												summary for more details on how this tool was implemented and what results were obtained.

											<p>This is an example of the notes that guided weekly staff meetings with TAs. The notes include an overview of the weekly schedule, 
												priorities for discussion and lab, and tips for dealing with challenging situations.

											<h4>Literature deconstruction activity</h4>
											<section></section>
											<p>This is a discussion activity containing comprehension questions about a journal article that analytical chemistry students were required to read in preparation
												for their course-integrated research project (the topic was quantifying iron in beer). The activity was meant to scaffold students' reading of the article, 
												since this was the first time some of them were encountering this type of scientific writing.

											<h4>Assisting the transition to Online Learning</h4>
											<section></section>
											<p>As an analytical chemistry TA during the Spring 2020, I was part of the instructional team that faced a mid-semester unexpected 
												transition to online learning. Just prior to this transition, I had had the opportunity (through my Delta course and other events by the 
												CIRTL Network) to gain knowledge and training regarding how to facilitate online learning. I shared that knowledge with the analytical chemistry 
												team and helped the online transition by preparing training materials for TAs on how to facilitate synchronous discussion on Blackboard 
												Collaborate Ultra. The example document below was part of a training session that familiarized all TAs with the technical aspects of facilitating 
												online discussion. Feel free to contact me for a more detailed overview of the training process. After the end of that semester, my Delta instructor 
												Dr. Sarah Silverman and I co-facilitated an online CIRTL workshop on Leading Online Discussion (notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KGMcrZxbIMZ3OcoIrbppnB5siFBqRW2cW7Tmbvn2tE/edit">here</a>), where we shared both experiential and literature-based 
												insights into facilitating learning online.

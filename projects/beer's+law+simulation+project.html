										<p>	This simulation was developed to give undergraduate analytical chemistry students a more intuitive explanation as to why Beer's law (i.e., absorbance being directly proportional to concentration) holds. 
											Using a large number of particles falling through layers of cylinders, students can run "experiments" to determine how the number of layers of cylinders, the number of cylinders per layer, and the area 
											of each cylinder affect the number of particles that make it through the layers. An accompanying discussion worksheet (key) guides students as to which simulated experiments to try and how to use their 
											results to derive Beer's Law. </p>
											<p>In addition, this simulation could also be used to demonstrate laws of statistics, by students observing how many particles are transmitted for multiple identical runs. An example for that would be to 
												examine the relationship between the mean and the standard deviation of multiple measurements, which would likely follow a Poisson distribution.</p>
											<p>Check out the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c01433" 
											target="_blank">publication</a> of the Beer's Law Simulation activity in the Journal of Chemistry Education! It's the result of an ongoing colaboration between the instructional team of 
											analytical chemistry at UW-Madison (Dr. Pamela Doolittle, Dr. Amanda Buchberger) and Dr. Sam Pazicni. The current focus of our project is determining how a simulation-based activity such as 
											this one can support students' modeling about absorption. </p>

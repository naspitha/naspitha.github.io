									<article class="box post">
										<p>	August 18th, 2012 was the first day I stepped foot on the
											US. A fellow Greek senior student, who had been assigned as
											my mentor, picked me up from the airport and brought me to
											Davidson, NC where I would begin my first week of
											international student orientation for freshmen. The tables
											have seemingly turned since then. As an undergraduate
											international student, I was eagerly “reaping the benefits”
											of my mentors’ and teachers’ efforts to help integrate me
											into the classroom and college community; now, as a
											graduate chemistry teaching assistant and future instructor, I strive to create
											learning environments for undergraduates where not only
											international students, but all under-represented students,
											can thrive along with their peers. </p>
											<p> Part of my motivation for moving abroad for my undergraduate and graduate studies
												was the vastness of professional opportunities and the conviction that, if I worked 
												"hard enough," I could accomplish any goal I set for myself. As time progressed,
												I realized that the ideal of "meritocracy" was only half the truth. This became 
												particularly evident to me after I started teaching others and my perspective expanded
												from how I (one student, from a middle-class Greek family who could afford a private school) 
												experienced learning, to how each of my students (with their multitude of backgrounds and 
												experiences) experienced it. Through my involvement in a variety of teaching, learning,
												teaching-as-research, and professional development experiences, I have become familiar with many of the
												circumstances that can affect my students’ learning. Some may be working part-time jobs, or even raising a child,
												which makes it hard for them to utilize time-sensitive resources such as office hours. Some may be suffering from
												a disability that makes learning in the classroom and laboratory much more difficult. Due to their socioeconomic
												or cultural background, some of them may face language barriers, stereotype threat (i.e. anxiety and risk about 
												conforming to negative stereotypes of one's culture), or simply a lower level of preparation compared to the rest 
												of their classmates. Given these disparities of circumstances, it is obvious that it's not enough to 
												"treat all students equally" and expect their performance in my class to accurately represent their "merit."</p>
												
												<p>Learning environments should be <em>equitable,</em> not plainly equal. For university courses (especially 
													introductory ones), equitable design means reflecting carefully on what the course assesses, and ensuring 
													that students are, to the extent possible, evaluated on the skills that we teach them, and not just on their prior preparation.
													It can also entail rethinking the requirements and restrictions imposed on students and whether those restrictions
													are necessary for students' learning and/or fair evaluation (e.g. time allotted on an exam, or attendance requirements). 
													Students have different strengths and needs; as far as we can ensure that everyone is fairly evaluated for our courses'
													essential learning outcomes, we should be open-minded about restructuring courses to allow every student to achieve at those
													outcomes in the manner they can best do so. A student’s
													non-traditional background may offer them unique strengths
													(such as multilingual abilities, experiential knowledge, engaging communication skills, or a good
													work ethic) that, as instructors, we should notice and
													allow students to fruitfully apply to their learning. It is
													essential that our teaching methods and curricular design can accommodate the
													needs of all students, while at the same time, allowing
													each student to utilize their strengths to succeed in our
													courses. </p>
													
											<p>As much time as we could spend listing and “studying” how
											every type of circumstance affects student learning, a
											lifetime would not suffice for us to be able to perfectly
											serve the needs of each and every student simply through the <em>a priori</em> design of courses.
											This is why I think that
											the most important strategy for creating an inclusive
											teaching environment is the continuous and conscientious
											assessment of our students’ experience in the classroom,
											and the subsequent refinement of our teaching techniques –
											in a few words, listening to our students’ needs. A
											strategy that I have seen work well is, for example,
											administering an initial survey at the beginning of the
											semester that asks students about their goals and
											expectations for the course, as well as for suggestions on
											what the instructor(s) can do to support their success in
											the course. For me, this strategy can be even more
											effective if the assessment continues throughout the
											semester, e.g. in the form of post-discussion surveys or by
											reaching out to students individually – especially if they
											appear disengaged from or struggling with the course. </p>
											<p>As we learn more about our student’s background and needs,
											the next task is meeting those diverse needs, which can be
											especially challenging within synchronous learning
											environments. A number of strategies that I follow have
											proven helpful for that end: for example, when teaching
											discussion, I have found that using neutral language,
											allowing for different paces for completing in-class
											activities, avoiding assumptions about students’ prior
											knowledge, and directing students to resources they can
											consult to “refresh” their knowledge, are all effective
											techniques for maintaining the engagement of all students.
											However, I anticipate that, as I am faced with new groups
											of students, I will need to continuously reflect on,
											assess, and refine my teaching approach. While I could
											never know what type of road lies ahead, I am confident
											that my motivation to improve my inclusive teaching skills
											will persist; as an underrepresented student myself, I have
											been fortunate enough to have had teachers who not only
											accepted, but actively encouraged my contributions to the
											classroom, so my primary goal as an instructor is to pay it
											forward and to see as many of my students succeed in my
											courses and beyond.</p>

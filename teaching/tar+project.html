											<p>Teaching As Research (TAR) reflects a cycle of refining one's teaching 
												plan similarly to how one would conduct research; by identifying challenges,
												consulting the literature for evidence-based practices to address them, and developing an implementation
												and assessment plan founded on the alignment between learning outcomes, assessments, and
												activities. It is one of the central pillars of the CIRTL Network <em>(Center for the Integration of 
													Research, Teaching, and Learning)</em>.</p>
										</div>
										<p>	I pursued a TAR project as part of my <a href="https://delta.wisc.edu/pillars/" 
											target="_blank">Delta</a> internship in the Spring semester of 2019. At the time, 
											I had been assigned a Project Assistant role in the analytical chemistry program at UW-Madison, 
											which was in the process of redesigning parts of its curriculum. The main components of the UW-Madison 
											analytical chemistry courses are lecture, lab, disussion, which serves mostly to prepare students for labs, 
											and the "project lab," which is a course-integrated group research project 
											that spans several weeks of the lab curriculum. The topic of the research project can change depending 
											on the instructor of record, and Spring 2019 was one of the first iterations of a relatively new project topic: 
											developing a spectrophotometric method to quantify iron in beer. The challenge I was asked to address 
											during my appointment was to develop curriculum materials that would better "string together" 
											the research project with the other components of the course. Specifically, course instructors had identified 
											a difficulty of students with transitioning from the traditional "cookbook" labs of the course to the more 
											open-ended project-lab.</p>
										<p>	To improve the integration of the project lab into the rest of the course, I developed a set of discussion activities 
											and a weekly survey that attempted to help students relate either (i) the topic or (ii) the techniques of each "regular" lab 
											with the research project. In addition, to support students' development of autonomy throughout the course labs, 
											the instructional team of the course placed emphasis, during TA training, on teaching assistants being deliberate in 
											how they addressed questions from students: TAs were strongly advised to not give students direct answers, but rather 
											use leading questions and/or model their own thinking, so that the students gradually become more independent in tackling 
											experimental challenges. Finally, to faciliate collaborative work between students, a set of activities (contract, 
											mid-project peer evaluations) were given to student groups throughout the semester to clarify within-group roles and resolve
											possible conflicts. </p>
										<p>	As part of my TAR investigation, I looked at how different features of the curriculum (including both new and existing 
											factors) affected students' confidence in transitioning into and succeeding at the project lab. The two main research 
											questions I asked were:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Which course components and activities do students perceive as most helpful for developing confidence around 
													the research project?</li>
												<li>To what extent do teaching assistants' self-reported question-answering approaches influence student autonomy
													in the lab?</li>
											</ul>
										<p>To address the first question, an end-of-semester survey asked
											students to report their level of confidence in "tackling challenges associated with scientific research" before and after the course, 
											well as to rate various course components (on a 1-5 Likert scale) according to the degree to which they (positively or negatively) impacted their level of 
											confidence. Students reported higher levels of confidence around scientific research after the end of the course, and cited interactions with 
											TAs (4.4), interactions with fellow group members (4.3), and non-project labs (4.1) as the top three factors that positively affected their 
											"impact and ability to succeed in the research project." While the activities designed were not explicitly recognized as most helpful (3.6/5), 
											they likely contributed to students' ability to relate their experience from non-project labs to the research project. Moreover, the fact that students
											found each other to be one of the most positively impactful resources shows the importance of learning communities (one of the Delta pillars!) in
											one's development as a scientist. </p>

										<p>For the second question, the nine TAs of the course were asked to record the number, category (strategic, equipment troubleshooting, or conceptual), 
											and quality ("basic," "insightful," or feedback-seeking) of questions they received during the project 
											lab by their students. At the end of the project lab, I interviewed each TA about their question-answering approach and, based on their answers, divided the TAs into two 
											categories; in the first category, students had a more passive role in the answering of their question (direct answer, guided explanation, or 
											referral to a specific resource), while in the second category, students had a more active role (TA applying a Socratic method, modeling their 
											own thought process, or directing the question back to a group of students). Interestingly, the quality of questions asked by students to 
											TAs in the second category showed a greater improvement from "basic" to "insightful" and "feedback-seeking" across project lab days compared to students 
											of TAs in the first category. Given that all students ultimately succeeded at the project, this observation validates that, when TAs give students 
											an active role in answering their own questions, students will gradually become more autonomous in experimental research tasks.</p>

										<p>The methods and results of this qualitative project were presented as a <a href="https://uwmadison.app.box.com/s/bvejf7swuvdfyp380wy77r12ns8wsu6q" target="_blank">
											poster</a> during the 2019 CIRTL Forum in Philadelphia. Reflecting on my Delta TAR project, I am extremely grateful for the experience, as it sparked my 
											initial interest in curricular assessment and, by extension, chemistry education research. My project design did, in retrospect, have several points 
											that could be improved to make my findings more meaningful and generalizable. Given that my job as project assistant during that semester involved small changes 
											throughout the curriculum, I had an unrealistic expectation that I would be able to simultaneously evaluate the impact of all of the changes. This, of course, introduced
											a surplus of variables into my study, compromising the validity of each conclusion. Despite such shortcomings, my teaching-as-research experience allowed me to repeatedly
											practice the principle of backwards design and introduced me to a variety of principles and methods that have helped my subsequent qualitative studies about learning.</p>

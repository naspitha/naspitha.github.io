											<p>Teaching As Research (TAR) reflects a cycle of refining one's teaching 
												plan similarly to how one would conduct research; by identifying challenges,
												consulting the literature for evidence-based practices to address them, and developing an implementation
												and assessment plan founded on the alignment between learning outcomes, assessments, and
												activities. It is one of the three central pillars of the <a href="https://www.cirtl.net/" target = "_blank">CIRTL Network</a>, along with <em>Learning Communities</em> and <em>Learning-through-Diversity.</em>.</p>

										<!-- <p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p> -->
										<h4><strong>Project Summary</strong></h4>
										<p>	I pursued a TAR project as part of my <a href="https://delta.wisc.edu/pillars/" 
											target="_blank">Delta</a> internship in the Spring semester of 2019. At the time, 
											I had been assigned a Project Assistant role in the analytical chemistry program at UW-Madison, 
											which was in the process of redesigning parts of its curriculum. My responsibilities included organizing discussion structure, advising 
											teaching assistants in staff meetings and through weekly notes, and preparing and disseminating course materials. Overall, my work spanned 
											nine TA-led discussion/lab sections divided into two analytical chemistry lecture sections (72 + 68 students, 2 lecturers, 9 TAs). The challenge I was asked to address 
											during my appointment was to develop curriculum materials that would better "string together" 
											a course integrated research project with the other course components. Specifically, 
											course instructors had cited a difficulty of students with transitioning from the traditional "cookbook" labs of the course to the more 
											open-ended project lab.</p>
										<p>	To improve the integration of the project lab into the rest of the course, I developed a set of discussion activities 
											and a weekly survey that attempted to help students relate either (i) the topic or (ii) the techniques of each "regular" lab 
											with the research project. In addition, to support students' development of autonomy throughout the course labs, 
											the instructional team of the course placed emphasis, during TA training, on teaching assistants being deliberate in 
											how they addressed questions from students: TAs were strongly advised to not give students direct answers, but rather 
											use leading questions and/or model their own thinking, so that the students gradually become more independent in tackling 
											experimental challenges. Finally, to faciliate collaborative work between students, a set of activities (contract, 
											mid-project peer evaluations) were given to student groups throughout the semester to clarify within-group roles and resolve
											possible conflicts. </p>
										<p>	As part of my TAR project, I looked at how different features of the curriculum (including both new and existing 
											factors) affected students' confidence in transitioning into and succeeding at the project lab. Writing a proposal in preparation for 
											my Delta internship was helpful in organizing the new features introduced into the curriculum (such as discussion activities and  
											literature-interpretation worksheets) and ensuring that assessments and interventions were aligned with intended learning outcomes 
											of the course (<em>backwards design</em>). Among the different cognitive and affective learning outcomes that were considered, my TAR questions
											were focused on the development of students' confidence and autonomy pertaining to scientific research. Specifically, I asked: </p>
											<ul>
												<li>Which course components and activities do students perceive as most helpful for developing confidence around 
													the research project?</li>
												<li>To what extent do teaching assistants' self-reported question-answering approaches influence student autonomy
													in the lab?</li>
											</ul>
										<p>To address the first question, an end-of-semester survey asked
											students to report their level of confidence in "tackling challenges associated with scientific research" before and after the course, 
											well as to rate various course components (on a 1-5 Likert scale) according to the degree to which they (positively or negatively) impacted their level of 
											confidence. Students reported higher levels of confidence around scientific research after the end of the course, and cited interactions with 
											TAs (4.4), interactions with fellow group members (4.3), and non-project labs (4.1) as the top three factors that positively affected their 
											"impact and ability to succeed in the research project."The activities designed were not explicitly recognized as most helpful (3.6/5), although they 
											may have contributed to students' ability to relate their experience from regular labs to the research project. Moreover, the fact that students
											found each other to be one of the most positively impactful resources shows the importance of learning communities in
											one's development as a scientist. As with all self-reported results, it should be noted that there may be some discrepancy between what students <em>perceive</em> as most
											helpful or enjoyable in the course and what actually is most supportive for their learning. </p>

											negative to strongly positive for their impact on students' confidence and ability to succeed in the research project. Interactions with TA, interactions with group

										<p>For the second question, I developed a <a href="/files/ta-questiontracker.pdf">question-tracking tool</a> whereby the nine TAs of the course were asked to track the number, category (strategic, equipment troubleshooting, or conceptual), 
											and quality of questions they received during the project lab by their students. At the end of the project lab, I interviewed each TA about their question-answering approach and, based on their answers, divided the TAs into two 
											categories; in the first category, students had a more passive role in the answering of their question (direct answer, guided explanation, or 
											referral to a specific resource), while in the second category, students had a more active role (TA applying a Socratic method, modeling their 
											own thought process, or directing the question back to a group of students). Interestingly, the quality of questions asked by students to 
											TAs in the second category showed a greater improvement from "basic" to "insightful" and "feedback-seeking" across project lab days compared to students 
											of TAs in the first category. Given that all students ultimately succeeded at the project, this observation validates that, when TAs give students 
											an active role in answering their own questions, students will gradually become more autonomous in experimental research tasks.</p>

										<h4><strong>"Fruits" of my TAR project</strong></h4>	
										<ul>The methods and results of this qualitative project were presented as a <a href="https://uwmadison.app.box.com/s/bvejf7swuvdfyp380wy77r12ns8wsu6q" target="_blank">
											poster</a> during the 2019 CIRTL Forum in Philadelphia. During my semester as Project Assistant, I had the opportunity to introduce and evaluate a number of new elements to the 
											analytical chemistry curriculum (some of those materials can be found in my <a href="/teaching/example+artifacts.html">Example Artifacts</a> page). The information we collected from students, TAs, and staff meeting discussions, which pertained to issues besides the two TAR questions discussed here, 
											helped solidify actionable decisions for the following semesters, such as which activities to prioritize in discussion. Several activities that I designed have since been 
											fully incorporated into the course; for example, a set of literature deconstruction activities (<a href="/files/literature-activity.pdf">example</a>) I created to assist students' preparation for the project lab were permanently 
											incorporated into the course, with later project assistants creating analogous documents for other literature articles used in the course. I have continued to regularly collaborate and 
											consult with course staff (especially my TAR faculty advisor Dr. Pamela Doolittle) around improvements to the course and, most excitingly, about more education-research-oriented 
											projects that originated from the semester of my TAR project (e.g. the Beer's Law Simulation). </p>

										<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
										<p> Reflecting on my Delta TAR project, I am extremely grateful for the experience, as it sparked my 
											initial interest in curricular assessment and, eventually, chemistry education research. My project design did, in retrospect, have several points 
											that could be improved to make my findings more meaningful and generalizable. Given that my job as project assistant during that semester involved small changes 
											throughout the curriculum, I had an unrealistic expectation that I would be able to simultaneously evaluate the impact of all of the introduced changes. This, of course, introduced
											a surplus of variables into my study, compromising the validity of each conclusion. The process of pooling information collected by the TAs of the course was the most
											interesting for me, although many aspects of that process should have been executed differently for any generalizable conclusions to be drawn; for example, 
											in a more rigorous research setting, TAs (or other researchers) would have been trained to employ a consistent question-tracking method, and I should have employed
											an observation protocol instead of asking TAs to self-report how they answered questions. Despite such shortcomings, my teaching-as-research experience allowed me to repeatedly
											practice the principle of backwards design and introduced me to a variety of principles and methods. These tools have already been helpful for my subsequent qualitative studies about learning, and will help 
											me as I continuously informally assess and refine my own teaching.</p>
											<p> Completing my Delta internship has (among other Delta and non-Delta experiences) also shown me the importance of <em>learning communities,</em> which to me is closely tied to the concept of
												<em>learning through diversity</em>. On one hand, working closely with the analytical chemistry curriculum, which places a lot of importance on group work, has shown me that students's experience in a course is improved
												through peer interactions; not only because of students' ability to relate to (and, let's be honest, commiserate with) each other as they are taking the same course(s), but because 
												the construction of knowledge has been repeatedly shown to be, in part, a social process. Each community member, with their array of experiences, contributes to 
												the group knowledge, while the presence of diverse mindsets in a group deepens an individual's knowledge by motivating them to communicate and view it from different lenses. I myself had the same experience in my own courses, 
												and even within my cohort of Delta interns, where the contributions of each person in class (who came from a variety of disciplines) led to the betterment of each of our very-different projects. Of course, about a year after the completion
												of my TAR project, I received the ultimate "wake up call" to the importance of learning communities, given that the COVID-19 pandemic made it much more difficult to form and maintain them. The first few days that my labmates and I returned to the research
												group office, after over a year of working from home except for laboratory work, were extremely refreshing, as we were again able to organically bounce ideas off of each other,
												which made it easier to understand and strategize about complex tasks. This and the above-mentioned experiences have made me think much more intentionally about
												leveraging the learning community and learning-through diversity principles when I help others learn, which I look forward to doing as a chemistry instructor.

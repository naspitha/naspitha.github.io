										<h3>Diversity Statement</h3>
										<p>	August 18th, 2012 was the first day I stepped foot on the
											US. A fellow Greek senior student, who had been assigned as
											my mentor, picked me up from the airport and brought me to
											Davidson, NC where I would begin my first week of
											international student orientation for freshmen. The tables
											have seemingly turned since then. As an undergraduate
											international student, I was eagerly “reaping the benefits”
											of my mentors’ and teachers’ efforts to help integrate me
											into the classroom and college community; now, as a
											graduate chemistry teaching assistant, I strive to create
											learning environments for undergraduates where not only
											international students, but all under-represented students,
											can thrive along with their peers. </p>
											<p>Through my involvement in a variety of teaching, learning,
											teaching-as-research, and professional development
											experiences, I have become familiar with a variety of
											circumstances that can affect my students’ learning: some
											may be working part-time jobs, or even raising a child,
											which makes it hard for them to utilize time-sensitive
											resources such as office hours. Some may be suffering from
											a disability that makes learning in the classroom and
											laboratory much more difficult. Due to their socioeconomic
											or cultural background, some of them may face language
											barriers, stereotype threat, or simply a lower level of
											preparation compared to the majority of their classmates.
											On the opposite end of the spectrum, a student’s
											non-traditional background may offer them unique skills
											(such as multilingual abilities, code-switching, or a good
											work ethic) that, as instructors, we should notice and
											allow students to fruitfully apply to their learning. It is
											essential that our teaching methods can accommodate the
											needs of all students, while at the same time, allowing
											each student to utilize their strengths to succeed in our
											courses.</p>
											<p>As much time as we could spend listing and “studying” how
											every type of circumstance affects student learning, a
											lifetime would not suffice for us to be able to perfectly
											serve the needs of each student. This is why I think that
											the most important strategy for creating an inclusive
											teaching environment is the continuous and conscientious
											assessment of our students’ experience in the classroom,
											and the subsequent refinement of our teaching techniques –
											in a few words, listening to our students’ needs. A
											strategy that I have seen work well is, for example,
											administering an initial survey at the beginning of the
											semester that asks students about their goals and
											expectations for the course, as well as for suggestions on
											what the instructor(s) can do to support their success in
											the course. For me, this strategy can be even more
											effective if the assessment continues throughout the
											semester, e.g. in the form of post-discussion surveys or by
											reaching out to students individually – especially if they
											appear disengaged from or struggling with the course. </p>
											<p>As we learn more about our student’s background and needs,
											the next task is meeting those diverse needs, which can be
											especially challenging within synchronous learning
											environments. A number of strategies that I follow have
											proven helpful for that end: for example, when teaching
											discussion, I have found that using neutral language,
											allowing for different paces for completing in-class
											activities, avoiding assumptions about students’ prior
											knowledge, and directing students to resources they can
											consult to “refresh” their knowledge, are all effective
											techniques for maintaining the engagement of all students.
											However, I anticipate that, as I am faced with new groups
											of students, I will need to continuously reflect on,
											assess, and refine my teaching approach. While I could
											never know what type of road lies ahead, I am confident
											that my motivation to improve my inclusive teaching skills
											will persist; as an underrepresented student myself, I have
											been fortunate enough to have had teachers who not only
											accepted, but actively encouraged my contributions to the
											classroom, so my primary goal as an instructor is to pay it
											forward and to see as many of my students succeed in my
											courses and beyond.</p>

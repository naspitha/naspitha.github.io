										<h3>Teaching-As-Research Project</h3>
										<div id="highlight" class="container">
											<p>Teaching As Research (TAR) reflects a cycle of refining one's teaching 
												plan similarly to how one would conduct research; by identifying challenges,
												consulting the literature for evidence-based practices to address them, and developing an implementation
												and assessment plan founded on the alignment between learning outcomes, assessments, and
												activities. It is one of the central pillars of the <a href="https://delta.wisc.edu/pillars/" 
												target="_blank">Delta</a> program at UW-Madison and the main objective of the 
												Delta Internship.</p>
										</div>
										<p>	I pursued a TAR project as part of my Delta internship in the Spring semester of 2019. At the time, 
											I had been assigned a Project Assistant role in the analytical chemistry program at UW-Madison, 
											which was in the process of redesigning parts of its curriculum. The main components of the UW-Madison 
											analytical chemistry courses are lecture, lab, disussion, which serves mostly to prepare students for labs, 
											and the "project lab," which is a course-integrated group research project 
											that spans several weeks of the lab curriculum. The topic of the research project can change depending 
											on the instructor of record, and Spring 2019 was one of the first iterations of a relatively new project topic: 
											developing a spectrophotometric method to quantify iron in beer. The challenge I was asked to address 
											during my appointment was to develop curriculum materials that would better "string together" 
											the research project with the other components of the course. Specifically, course instructors had identified 
											a difficulty of students with transitioning from the traditional "cookbook" labs of the course to the more 
											open-ended project-lab.</p>
										<p>	To improve the integration of the project lab into the rest of the course, I developed a set of discussion activities 
											and a weekly survey that attempted to help students relate either (i) the topic or (ii) the techniques of each "regular" lab 
											with the research project. In addition, to support students' development of autonomy throughout the course labs, 
											the instructional team of the course placed emphasis, during TA training, on teaching assistants being deliberate in 
											how they addressed questions from students: TAs were strongly advised to not give students direct answers, but rather 
											use leading questions and/or model their own thinking, so that the students gradually become more independent in tackling 
											experimental challenges. </p>
										<p>	As part of my TAR investigation, I looked at how different features of the curriculum (including both new and existing 
											factors) affected students' confidence in transitioning into and succeeding at the project lab. The two main research 
											questions I asked were:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Which course components and activities do students perceive as most helpful for developing confidence around 
													the research project?</li>
												<li>To what extent do teaching assistants' self-reported question-answering approaches influence student autonomy
													in the lab?</li>
											</ul>
											<p>The results of this project were presented as a <a href="https://uwmadison.app.box.com/s/bvejf7swuvdfyp380wy77r12ns8wsu6q" target="_blank">
												poster</a> during the 2019 CIRTL Forum in Philadelphia.</p>

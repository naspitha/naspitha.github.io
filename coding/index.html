				<p>The following projects were all created to fulfill various purposes throughout my academic research and teaching. I have been programming in Python since ca. 2015, HTML/CSS since ca. 2020 (to build this website!), and Javascript (mostly D3.js and jQuery) since 2022. I am self-taught programmer, most of my programming knowledge developed as-needed for the given project that I was working on. I have been learning as I go and look forward to continuing to grow in that domain!</p>
				<p>Below are my most recent projects; click on one to learn more about it!</p>

										<h3>SILC</h3>

									<img src="/images/simLogo_desc.svg">
									<p> SILC stands for <em>Simulationen f√ºr Interaktives Lernen in Chemie</em> (<em>Simulations for Interactive Learning in Chemistry</em>)! It is a library of newly simulations and activities on topics across the early undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The activities were originally developed in German, in order to be used at the introductory chemistry course at the Humboldt University of Berlin. They are currently being translated into English.

										<h3>Beer's Law Simulation</h3>
									</header>
									<img src="/images/BLSim-wide.png">
									<p>This simulation was developed to give undergraduate analytical chemistry students 
										a more intuitive explanation as to why Beer's law (i.e. absorbance being directly 
										proportional to concentration) holds. We are currently investigating the effects 
										of an activity based on this simulation on students' reasoning about the phenomenon 
										of absorption.

										<h3>KinetiKit</h3>
									</header>
									<img src="/images/use_kinetikit.jpg">
									<p><em>KinetiKit</em> is a Python-based software package that I developed during my graduate work. 
										It can be used to analyze temporal data (in my case, time-resolved photoluminescence of semiconductors) 
									using models of any desired complexity that represent the physical behavior of particles in a system.</p>
